## Observations
Here are some observations I made while coding that I am a little confused about:
1. When creating any functions that take in fstream parameters, their implementation works only when I pass in these parameters by reference and consequently change the original function definition. Is there a particular reason for that?
2. It seems that using pointers makes working with any functions that have fstream parameters a lot easier. Is this the case?

## Qiuestions
1. Should I have a distructor?
