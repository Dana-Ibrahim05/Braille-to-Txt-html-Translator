# Planning Document
This document is where we can put our planning for this project. It also includes pseudocode and steps.
## Step 1: File IO basics
This step is the foundation of the program. We build the basic file IO system that allows the program to copy the contents of the braille file into a text file. IMplented as follows:

1. Create 2 file objects: one for the input (braille) and another for writing to the text file.
2. open the braille file.
3. use a string to store each word.
4. write each string to the new file
## step 2 (A): translating contractions.
There are over 150 contractions in braille, some of them being one-cell symbols and other being 2 (or more) letter combinations.
We therefore must create rules to allow the program to  translate these contractions.
The tool I am thinking of  is a list of if-statements, but I believe this can be done more efficiently.
## Step 2 (B): Translating math formulas
This step is similar to the previous, except that some of the symbols in contractions and the symbols in math overlap, and therefore we must create another set of rules to allow this translation to occur without causing any mistranslation of math content into text and vice versa.

## Step 3: Formatting
It would be very helpful to have a converted file that has some element of formatting, particularly headings. Headings assist in navigation and significantly speed it up. These can be used to mark slide numbers, as well as section titltes.
